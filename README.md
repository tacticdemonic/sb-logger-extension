## 📖 Usage

### Basic Workflow
1. **Visit** [surebet.com/valuebets](https://surebet.com/valuebets)
2. **Click** the 💾 Save button on any bet row or click the stake indicator
3. **Enter** your stake amount (and optional note)
4. **View** all saved bets by clicking the extension icon in your toolbar
5. **Settle bets** using the ✓ Won, ✗ Lost, or ○ Void buttons
6. **Track progress** with the P/L summary and 📊 View Chart button
7. **Export data** using the JSON or CSV export buttons

### Auto-Fill Stakes (Exchange Bets)
When enabled, the extension automatically fills in your calculated Kelly stake after clicking a bet link:

1. **Enable auto-fill** in the extension settings (⚙️ Auto-Fill tab)
2. **Select exchanges** you want to use (Betfair, Smarkets, Matchbook)
3. **Click a stake link** on surebet.com → your calculated stake will auto-populate on the betting slip
4. **Review and place** your bet on the exchange

**Note**: Auto-fill requires the Surebet official plugin to find and add the bet first. Falls back to clipboard copy if auto-fill fails.

### Bookmaker Filter Presets

The extension adds quick-filter buttons to the bookmaker filter popup:
- **⭐ My Normal List** - Your standard bookmaker selection
- **🔄 Exchanges Only** - Filter to betting exchanges only

Customize these presets in `contentScript.js` by editing the `BOOKMAKER_PRESETS` object.

### Settings Available

Click the extension icon to access:
- **⚙️ Commission** - Set exchange commission rates (Betfair, Betdaq, Matchbook, Smarkets)
- **⚙️ Rounding** - Enable stake rounding to nearest increment (e.g., £0.50)
- **⚙️ Auto-Fill** - Configure automatic stake input (disabled by default, per-exchange toggles)

---

## ⚙️ Optional Features

### Auto-Fill Stakes on Betting Exchanges

Automatically populate betting slip stake fields after the Surebet plugin adds your bet:

1. Click **⚙️ Auto-Fill** in the popup settings
2. Enable **"Enable automatic stake input on betting slip"**
3. Select which exchanges to use (Betfair, Smarkets, Matchbook)
4. When you click a stake link from surebet.com, your calculated stake will auto-fill

**Features:**
- Waits for betting slip to appear after Surebet plugin finds the bet
- Automatically detects when stake input is ready
- Fills the correct stake input (handles back/lay bets)
- Shows confirmation toast notification
- Falls back to clipboard copy if auto-fill fails
- Disabled by default for safety

- **The Odds API** (multiple sports) - 500 requests/month free

### Setup Guide

## 📊 What Gets Saved

Each bet record includes:
- **Timestamp** - When you saved it
- **Bookmaker** - Betting site (e.g., Bet365, Betfair)
- **Sport** - Sport type
- **Event** - Match/game name
- **Tournament** - League/competition
- **Market** - Bet type (e.g., "Home", "Over 2.5")
- **Odds** - Decimal odds value
- **Probability** - Calculated probability %
- **Overvalue** - Value edge %
- **Stake** - Your bet amount
- **Potential Return** - Stake × Odds
- **Profit** - Potential Return - Stake
- **Expected Value (EV)** - Theoretical expected profit
- **Status** - Pending/Won/Lost/Void
- **Settled At** - Settlement timestamp
- **Actual P/L** - Real profit/loss after settlement
- **Note** - Optional personal note
- **URL** - Link back to the original page

---

## 🧮 Understanding Expected Value (EV)

Expected Value is the theoretical average profit you'd make on a bet if placed many times:

```
EV = (Win Probability × Win Amount) - (Lose Probability × Stake)
```

**Example:** $10 stake at 2.50 odds with 41.51% probability:
```
EV = (0.4151 × $10 × 2.50) - (0.5849 × $10)
EV = $10.38 - $5.85 = +$4.53
```

### Summary Metrics
- **Total EV**: Sum of EV for all bets (theoretical expected profit)
- **P/L**: Actual profit/loss for settled bets
- **Expected (Settled)**: Sum of EV for settled bets only
- **vs Expected**: Difference between actual and expected (luck factor)

Over 100+ bets, actual results should approach expected value if probabilities are accurate.
